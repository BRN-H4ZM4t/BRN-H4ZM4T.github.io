         <p>I started drawing in 2020 during the beginning of the pandemic. I needed something to put my mind to and
            dedicated my self to
            learning how to draw while keeping up with my studies the best I could while online. My very first car
            drawing was a Nissan GTR
            that I drew after a year of practice. The year prior I was in a battle bot team in the 8th grade. I was in
            charge of coding and
            co-leader of design. Our bot only made it one round into the tournament but it's something I'm very proud
            about doing at a young age.</p>
